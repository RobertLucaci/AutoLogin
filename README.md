# Autologin
Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship and as a programmer I wake up every morning, I make myself a coffee and I usually read thiThis tool I created is an example that mimics a login on a website using http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login and Selenium.s website because it is a great way to stay up to date with the industry.

# Why we use Testing/Automation?
If, let’s say, you have a company that is working on an app. You want to make sure this app works properly and what a lot of companies do is to hire Python Developers in order to help with testing/automation. 
Usually when people work with applications are human users, we perhaps touch the screen if the app is on a tablet or iPad or we submit a form, for that we need to test and automate this steps to make sure this applications work. 
Through programming we can actually interact with something like a browser or an app and mimic human actions to make sure that the application works as expected.

# Selenium
One of the best tools for browser automation is **Selenium**. It works not just with Python but with lots of programming languages. What it gives us is the ability to browse or use the browser without a human involved, just through code we can act and move around the mouse, clicking buttons and interact with the website.

# How can you run it?
You should copy the **autologin.py** file into your local computer.
Open it with your Text Editor or IDE and install all the necessary libraries.
Don’t forget to also **install Selenium drivers** for the browser you would use and make sure that the executable_path has your Selenium driver path. (In this project I used Selenium for Mozilla Firefox)
The only thing you have to do now to automate a login on a webpage is to write in your terminal: 

**python3 autologin.py**
